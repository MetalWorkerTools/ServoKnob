# ServoKnob
A PWM controlled RC servo that rotates a potentiometer for CNC control.
A small micro controller (ESP32-C3) monitors the PWM signal from a CNC controller. It positions an RC servo depending on the duty cylce of the PWM signal. The RC servo turns the knob that controls the motor speed. Doing so, "any" motor witch speed is controlled by a knob can be controlled by a CNC controller.
The micro controller has a OLED display and a rotory knob to controll the motor speed manually and setup the micro controller. For easy connection there is a PCB. You can also wirewrap the whole system.
