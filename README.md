# ServoKnob
A PWM controlled RC servo that rotates a potentiometer to set a motor speed by CNC control.
A small micro controller (ESP32-C3) monitors the PWM signal from a CNC controller. It positions a RC servo depending on the PWM duty cylcle. The RC servo turns the knob that controls the motor speed. Doing so, "any" motor witch speed is controlled by a knob can be controlled by a CNC controller. The micro controller has a OLED display and a rotary knob to control the motor speed manually and configure settings. For easy connection, there is a PCB designed using Eagle. You can also wire wrap the whole system. A Visual Studio Code project contains the firmware that is written in C++.
