# ServoKnob
A PWM controlled RC servo that rotates a potentiometer for CNC control.
A small micro controller (ESP32-C3) monitors the PWM signal from a CNC controller. It positions a RC servo depending on the PWM duty cylce. The RC servo turns the knob that controls the motor speed. Doing so, "any" motor witch speed is controlled by a knob can be controlled by a CNC controller PWM signal.
The micro controller has a OLED display and a rotory knob to controll the motor speed manually and setup the micro controller. For easy connection there is a PCB. You can also wirewrap the whole system. A Visual Studio Code project contains the firmware that is written in C++.
